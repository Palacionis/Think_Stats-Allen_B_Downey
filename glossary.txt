# Chapter 1

Anectodal evidence - evidence, often personal, that is collected casually rather than bu well-designed study
Population - a group we wre interested in studying. 'Population' often refers to a group of people. but the term is used for other subjects, too
Cross-sectional study - a study that collects data about a population at a particular point in time
Cycle - in a repeated cross-sectional study, each repetition of the study is called a cycle
Longitudinal study - a study that follows a population over time, collecting data from the same group repeatedly
Record - in a dataset, a collection of information about a single person or other subjects
Respondent - a person who responds to a survey
Sample - a subset of a population used to collect data
Representative - a sample is representative if every member of the population has the same chance of being in the sample
Oversampling - a technique of increasing the representation of a subpopulation in order to avoid errors due to small sample sizes
Raw data - values collected and recorded with little or no checking, calculation or interpretation
Recode - a value that is generated bu calculation and other logic applied to raw data
Data cleaning - process that include validating data, identifying errors, translating between data types, etc.

# Chapter 2

Distribution - the values that appear in a sample and the frequency of each
Histogram - a mapping from values to frequencies, or a graph that shows this mapping
Frequency- the number of times a value appears in a sample
Mode - the most frequent value in a sample, or one of the most frequent values
Normal distribution - an idealization of a bell-shaped distribution, also known as Gaussian distribution
Uniform distribution - a distribution in which all values have the same frequency
Tail - the part of a distribution at the high and low extremes
Central tendency - a characteristic of a sample or population, an average 
Outlier - a value far from the central tendency
Spread - a measure of how spread out the values in a distribution are
Summary statistic - a statistic that quantifies some aspect of a distribution, like average or spread
Variance - a summary statistic often used to quantify spread
Standard deviation - the square root of variance, also used as a measure of spread
Effect size - a summary statistic intended to quantify the size of an effect like a difference between groups
Clinically significant - a result, like a difference between two groups, that is relevant in practice

# Chapter 3

Probability Mass Function ( PMF ) - a representation of a distribution as a function that maps from values to probabilities
Probability - a frequency expressed as a fraction of the sample
Normalization - a process of dividing a frequency by a sample size to get a probability

# Chapter 4
Percentile rank - the percentage of values in a distribution that are less than or equal to a given value
Percentile - the value associated with a given percentile rank
Cumulative distribution function ( CDF ) - a function that maps from values to their cumulative probabilities. CDF(x) is the fraction of the sample less than or equal to x
Inverse CDF - a function that maps from a cumulative probability, p, to the corresponding value
Median - the 50th percentile, often used a a measure of central tendency
Interquartile range - the difference between the 75th and the 25th percentiles, used as a measure of spread
Quantile - a sequence of values that correspond to equally spaced percentile ranks, for example, the quartiles of a distribution are the 25th, 50th and the 75th percentiles
Replacement - a property of a sampling process. 'With replacement' means that the same value can be chosen more than once. 'Without replacement' means that once a value is chosen, it is removed from the population

# Chapter 5

Empirical distribution - the distribution of values in a sample
Analytic distribution - a distribution whose CDF is an analytic function
Model - a useful simplification. Analytic distributions are often good models of more complex empirical distributions
Interarrival time - the elapsed time between two events
Complementary CDF - a function that maps from a value x, to the fraction of values that exceed x, which is 1 - CDF(x)
Standard normal distribution - the normal distribution with mean 0 and standard deviation 1
Normal probability plot - a plot of the values in a sample versus random values from a standard normal distribution

# Chapter 6

Probability density function ( PDF ) - the derivative of a continuous CDF, a function that maps a value to its probability density
Probability density - a quantity that can be integrated over a range of values to yield a probability. If the values are in units of cm, for example, probability density is in units of probability per cm
Kernel density estimation ( KDE ) - an algorithm that estimates a PDF based on a sample
Discretize - to approximate a continuos function or distribution with a discrete function, the opposite of smoothing
Raw moment - a statistic based on the sum of data raised to a power
Central moment - a statistic based on deviation from the mean, raised to a power
Standardized moment - a ratio of moments that has no units
Skewness - a measure of how asymmetric a distribution is
Sample skewness - a moment-based statistic intended to quantify the skewness of a distribution
Pearson's median skewness coefficient - a statistic intended to quantify the skewness of a distribution based on the median, mean and standard deviation
Robust - a statistic is robus if it is relatively immune to the effect out outliers

# Chapter 7

Scatter plot - a visualization of the relationship between 2 variables, showing one point for each row of data
Jitter - random noise added to data for purposes of visualization
Saturation - loss of information when multiple points are plotted on top of each other
Correlation - a statistic that measures the strength of the relationship between two variables
Standardize - to transform a set of values so that their mean is 0 and their variance is 1
Standard score - a value that has been standardized so that it is expressed in standard deviations from the mean
Covariance - a measure of the tendency of two variables to vary together
Rank - the index where an element appears in a sorted list
Randomized controlled trial - an experimental design in which subjects are divided into groups at random and different groups are given different treatments
Treatment group - a group in a controlled trial that receives some kind of intervention
Control group - a group in a controlled trial that receives no treatment or a treatment whose effect is known
Natural experiment - an experimental design that takes advantage of a natural division of subjects into groups in ways that are at least approximately random
